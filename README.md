# MultiBuff
A multi buffing plugin for TShock

## Overview
This plugin makes it easier to give multiple buffs to someone by reading a certain file then making the server buff that specific player with the buffs from the file. :)

Lets say we wanted to buff someone in a game like PvP, we could create a file in the MultiBuff folder called PvPBuffs then add the buffs we need like Wrath and Iron Skin.

We now can go ingame and type /mbuff <playername> PvPBuffs
They will get those buffs.

If no folder is created just make one.
